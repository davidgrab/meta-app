# üìä Objective

This project, the **Modern Meta-Analysis App**, is an interactive Shiny application designed to provide researchers with a user-friendly interface for conducting comprehensive meta-analyses. The application's main goal is to make advanced statistical techniques accessible by guiding users through a structured workflow, from data upload and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and reporting.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Application Architecture & User Interface

The application is a standard **R Shiny app**, with its structure and functionality defined by the user interface (`R/ui.R`) and server-side logic (`R/server.R`). The UI, built with `bslib` for a modern look, reveals the application's capabilities to the end-user.

## User Interface Flow

The user journey is organized into a series of tabs:

1.  **Data Input & Preparation:**
    *   **Data Type Selection:** Users start by choosing between "Binary (2x2)" or "Continuous (SMD)" data.
    *   **Upload:** A file input allows users to upload their own `.csv` or `.xlsx` files.
    *   **Example Datasets:** Users can load pre-packaged datasets (e.g., "Hypericum for Depression," "BCG Vaccine," "Beta-Blockers") to explore the app's features.
    *   **Data Preview:** An interactive table (`DTOutput`) displays the loaded data for verification.

2.  **Analysis & Visualization Tabs:**
    *   **Overall Results:** Provides a high-level comparison of different meta-analysis models (Fixed, Random, Bivariate) through plots and summary tables.
    *   **Random Effects Analysis:** A multi-tabbed panel offering:
        *   **Forest Plots:** To visualize individual and pooled effect sizes.
        *   **Model Diagnostics:** Includes Q-Q plots, outlier detection, and effect distribution plots.
        *   **Publication Bias:** Features funnel plots, trim-and-fill plots, and Egger's test results.
        *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Includes leave-one-out plots, Baujat plots, and influence summaries.
    *   **Fixed Effects Analysis:** A similar panel dedicated to the fixed-effects model, with forest plots and model diagnostics.
    *   **Bivariate Analysis:** A specialized section for bivariate meta-analysis, likely for diagnostic test accuracy studies, featuring:
        *   Summary statistics and forest plots for sensitivity and specificity.
        *   SROC (Summary ROC) curves.
        *   Influence analysis and outlier detection plots.


# üìÑ Foundational Articles

The methods and example datasets used in this application Bivariate Analysis appear to be based on or inspired by the following academic work found within the project's directory:

-   **Saad et al (1).pdf**
-   **Supplementary material 310118.pdf**

These documents likely provide the theoretical underpinnings and context for the statistical models and analyses implemented in the app, particularly for the bivariate and advanced diagnostic sections. The presence of related R code (`analysis for BMJ paper.R`, `identify anomalous observations...Rmd`) further suggests that the app serves as an interactive implementation of the methods described in these papers.

# ‚ú® Final Notes

-   The application is structured entirely around the typical workflow of a meta-analyst.
-   The UI makes it clear that the app is both a tool for conducting analysis and a pedagogical instrument for understanding different models and their diagnostics.
-   The core strength of the app is its comprehensive coverage of analyses, from standard models to advanced diagnostics and bivariate approaches, all presented within an interactive graphical interface.
