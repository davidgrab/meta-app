# Meta-Analysis App

A comprehensive Shiny application for performing meta-analyses with advanced statistical methods, bivariate analysis, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

### Core Meta-Analysis Capabilities
- **Multiple Effect Size Measures**: Support for risk ratios (RR), odds ratios (OR), standardized mean differences, and more
- **Advanced Statistical Methods**: Fixed-effects, random-effects, and mixed-effects models
- **Bivariate Meta-Analysis**: Full support for both RR and OR with MLE estimation
- **Meta-Regression**: Advanced meta-regression with permutation tests for robust inference

### Statistical Enhancements
- **Permutation Testing**: Non-parametric significance testing for meta-regression
- **Comprehensive OR Support**: Complete odds ratio calculations with continuity corrections
- **Zero-Cell Handling**: Robust methods for studies with zero events
- **Influence Analysis**: Leave-one-out diagnostics and influence plots

### Visualization & Reporting
- **Interactive Forest Plots**: Dynamic visualizations with confidence intervals
- **Publication Bias Assessment**: Funnel plots, Egger's test, and trim-and-fill analysis
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Downloadable analysis reports with statistical summaries
- **Data Import/Export**: Support for CSV, Excel, and manual data entry

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/davidgrab/meta-app.git
   ```

2. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "meta", "metafor", "ggplot2", "plotly", "DT", "bslib", "shinyjs", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "gridExtra", "sp", "sf", "testthat","BiasedUrn","bsicons","readxl","shinycssloaders","pandoc"))
   ```

3. Run the app locally:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp("path/to/meta-app")
   ```

**Data Format:**
- For binary (2x2) data: columns should be `study`, `ie`, `it`, `pe`, `pt`
- For continuous data: columns should be `study`, `smd`, `ci_lower`, `ci_upper` (the SMD column may also be labeled `CoNC` or `HeadGrid-G`)
