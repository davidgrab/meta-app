# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for the Modern Meta-Analysis Shiny App.

## Analysis Capabilities
- **Network Meta-Analysis:** Implement methods for comparing multiple treatments simultaneously.
- **Meta-Regression:** Add functionality to investigate the relationship between study characteristics and effect sizes.
- **Dose-Response Meta-Analysis:** Incorporate models for analyzing dose-response data.
- **Support for Additional Data Types:** Extend the app to handle survival data (e.g., hazard ratios) and count data (e.g., incidence rates).

## Data Input and Management
- **User-Configurable Column Mapping:** Allow users to map their dataset's column names to the required names within the app, rather than relying on fixed names like `smd` or `CoNC`.
- **Data Transformation Tools:** Provide tools for data cleaning and transformation within the app (e.g., calculating effect sizes from raw data).

## Visualization
- **Advanced Plotting Options:** Include more visualization types, such as bubble plots for meta-regression, GOSH plots for influence analysis, and caterpillar plots.
- **Customizable Plots:** Give users more control over plot aesthetics (e.g., colors, fonts, labels).

## Quality of Life and User Experience
- **Interactive GRADE Assessment:** Enhance the GRADE quality assessment to be more interactive and guide users through the process.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Translate the user interface into multiple languages.
- **Improved Report Generation:** Allow more customization in the generated reports, such as letting users select which sections to include.

## Performance and Architecture
- **Modularization:** Further modularize the `server.R` logic to make it more maintainable and easier to test.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profile the app to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, especially for large datasets or complex analyses.
