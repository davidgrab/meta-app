# Executive Summary

This planning document outlines how to deliver **two major outputs** requested by the user:

1. **Comprehensive Technical Report** — explaining every R script in the `R/` folder, mapping each feature/UI tab to its underlying statistical methods, and evaluating whether the implementation faithfully follows the literature (Saad et al., Handbook of Meta-Analysis, Introduction to Meta-Analysis, etc.).
2. **Practitioner-Facing Post (Markdown)** — an engaging article that introduces the JCR (Joint Cumulative Ratio) bivariate approach, showcases the Shiny app, and invites feedback/contributions from clinicians and analysts.

The plan emphasises systematic code review, literature cross-validation, and clear communication for practitioners.

# Step-by-Step Plan

| # | Action | Purpose / Expected Output | Notes / Validation |
|--|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Catalogue project structure**<br>• Confirm all relevant files: `app.R`, `R/bivariate_meta.R`, `R/functions.R`, `R/server.R`, `R/ui.R`, datasets in `data/`, and `post.md`.<br>• List path to literature PDFs inside `articles_and_code_this_application_is_based_upon/thesis_artical_sources/`. | Establish complete scope before deep-dive. | Use `list_dir` to ensure no file is missed (especially supplementary material). |
| **2** | **Deep code walkthrough**<br>a. **`bivariate_meta.R`** — derive full algorithmic flow (effect-size computation, MLE, confidence regions, heterogeneity stats).<br>b. **`functions.R`** — catalogue helper, random/fixed, diagnostic, and plotting functions.<br>c. **`server.R`** — map reactive flow: data upload, analysis triggers, tab visibility, output rendering.<br>d. **`ui.R`** — enumerate tabs (Data Preview, Random Effects, Fixed Effects, Bivariate, Meta-Regression, Diagnostics, Publication Bias, etc.) and their inputs.<br>e. Track any sourcing (`source(...)`) or external package calls. | Build a **code-to-feature matrix** that links UI elements to backend computations. | Cross-reference `ggplot2`, `meta`, `metafor`, `BiasedUrn`, etc., ensuring each statistical output’s origin is clear. |
| **3** | **Literature review & extraction**<br>a. **Saad et al. 2019** PDF + supplementary — extract the exact formulas and estimation procedures for the bivariate log-ratio model.<br>b. **Handbook of Meta-Analysis (Chapter 11)** — note recommended diagnostics & publication-bias checks.<br>c. **Introduction to Meta-Analysis** — summarise foundational fixed/random models & heterogeneity metrics.<br>d. Any additional PDFs present. | Produce a **methods reference table** listing key equations, assumptions, and recommended interpretation guides. | Where PDFs are large, focus sections on methods & diagnostics (use pdfgrep, or read only necessary pages). |
| **4** | **Implementation validation**<br>• For each method/equation in the reference table, verify the Shiny code reproduces it (naming helper functions and line numbers).<br>• Check edge-case handling (zero cells continuity correction, heterogeneity estimator choices, log vs original scales, etc.). | Identify gaps, deviations, or potential bugs. | Mark items requiring follow-up research or unit tests. |
| **5** | **Assess diagnostic & publication-bias features**<br>• Validate normality tests, residual plots, funnel plots, leave-one-out, subgroup analysis, meta-regression logic against literature guidance.<br>• Ensure UI explanations match statistical reality (tool-tips, info buttons). | Provide verdict: *implemented correctly*, *partially*, or *missing* for each diagnostic. | If discrepancy, propose concrete fix (method + citation). |
| **6** | **Draft comprehensive report**<br>Structure:<br>1. Overview of the Shiny App.<br>2. Code Architecture & Data Flow.<br>3. Mathematical & Literature Foundations.<br>4. Feature-by-Feature Validation Table (with pass/fail).<br>5. Recommended Improvements.<br>6. References. | Deliver in Markdown for easy sharing. | Cite all literature with DOI/links. Include internal line references using `<mcfile>` and `<mcsymbol>` tags as required. |
| **7** | **Rewrite `post.md` for practitioners**<br>• Explain JCR approach in plain language.<br>• Highlight instant analysis capability & core diagnostics.<br>• Emphasise open-source nature and call-to-action for feedback/contributions.<br>• Include brief maths only where beneficial (CDF → efficiency home-plot).<br>• Tone: engaging, helpful, non-technical but accurate. | Aim for ~1500–1800 words, ready for Medium or similar. | Keep Markdown formatting: headings, bullet lists, code blocks for R usage examples. |
| **8** | **Quality checks**<br>• Proofread for clarity and consistency.<br>• Verify citations & code references render properly.<br>• Ensure README or inline links guide users to live demo or repo. | Final polish before delivery. | |
| **9** | **Clarification requests (if any)**<br>• Exact PDF filenames if paths differ.<br>• Confirmation whether meta-regression tab is expected in final report (code partially present). | Resolve outstanding ambiguities with user. | |

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
* **Large PDFs** — use targeted page extraction to stay efficient.
* **Hidden dependencies** — verify `renv.lock` to catch any un-listed packages.
* **Statistical edge cases (zero events, high heterogeneity)** — mention in report and suggest robustness checks.

---

## Deliverables
1. `full_technical_report.md` (or similar name agreed with user).
2. `post_practitioner.md` (rewritten post).

Both will be committed to the repository once validated.
